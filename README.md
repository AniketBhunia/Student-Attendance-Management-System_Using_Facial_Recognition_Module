# Student-Attendance-Management-System_Using_Facial_Recognition_Module

**Hi, welcome to the project readme file. So sit back and relax, and let me make you go through over the project components.**

## About:
### Problem:
Students attendance marking system always has been a boring and time consuming process. The process hasn't been updated enough from the past years and also in some areas they still take attendance using a notbook and a pen, which is definitely slow in process and but also there can a several incidents where wrong data has been inserted into the portal or in the datasheets. There can be a multiple discrepancy.
### Solution:
By using this project , my solution is to change this whole process into a automatic way.

- Detecting face using facial_recognition module rather than
  > looking for it during attendance will make is faster.
- Storing data directly into a database and get attendance details of a pecific date through a web page is faster than
  > going through the data records to find the specific date.
